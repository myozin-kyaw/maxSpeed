When I was away from school due to the unrest in Myanmar, I did my best to study web development on the W3 website, Youtube Channels, AP Laravel, and Laravel Documentation.

$search_val = $request->search;
        $books = Book::where('name','like','%'.$search_val.'%')->get();
        return view('search',compact('books'));
